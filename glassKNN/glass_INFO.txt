This code loads a dataset, performs data cleaning, and applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. It normalizes the features, splits the data into training and test sets, and evaluates the model's accuracy. It also tunes the hyperparameter k by testing values from 3 to 50, selecting the optimal k for better performance. The code visualizes the results and prints the accuracy score and confusion matrix.
