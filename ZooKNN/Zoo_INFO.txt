This code demonstrates classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset is loaded and cleaned, missing values are filled, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed with visualizations like histograms and boxplots. Features are normalized, and the data is split into training and testing sets. A KNN classifier is trained and evaluated for accuracy. To optimize the model, different values of k are tested, and the best-performing k is selected based on accuracy. Visualizations of accuracy trends are plotted, and final predictions are evaluated with a confusion matrix and accuracy score.
